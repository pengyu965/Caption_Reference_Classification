In the main scenario (left), instances were always mapped to VN classes, while in the OIP one (right) it was possible (during both training and test) to map instances as not belonging to any existing class.

The baseline system is described in the bottom (c & d), the separate panels highlighting the independent predictions of this model: sense labels are assigned in an entirely separate process from argument prediction. Pruning in the model takes place primarily in this tier, since we observe true predicates we only instantiate over these indices. The middle tier (b.) illustrates the syntactic representation layer, and the connective factors between syntax and SRL. In the observed syntax model the Link variables are clamped to their correct values, with no need for a factor to coordinate them to form a valid tree. Finally, the hidden model comprises all layers, including a combinatorial syntactic constraint (a.) over syntactic variables.

In contrast, the hidden model structure (right) learns a representation that closely parallels the desired end task predictions, helping it recover three of the four correct SRL predictions (shaded arcs: red corresponds to a correct prediction, with true labels GA, KARA, etc.), and providing some evidence towards the fourth. The dependency tree corresponding to the hidden structure is derived by edge-factored decoding: dependency variables whose beliefs > 0.5 are classified as true (though some arcs not relevant to the SRL predictions are omitted for clarity).

In the ATB, +2  3   asta\u2019adah is tagged 48 times as a noun and 9 times as verbal noun. Consequently, all three parsers prefer the nominal reading.

(b) POS tagging accuracy is lowest for maSdar verbal nouns (VBG,VN) and adjectives (e.g., JJ). Richer tag sets have been suggested for modeling morphologically complex distinctions (Diab, 2007), but we find that linguistically rich tag sets do not help parsing.
