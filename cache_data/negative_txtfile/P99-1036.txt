		The point is quite simple: differ  ent character sets should be treated differently and the changes between character types are very im  portant because Japanese script has both ideograms like Chinese (kanji) and phonograms like English (katakana).
		Both word segmentation accuracy and part of speech tagging accuracy are improved by the proposed model.
		The model can achieve 96.6% tag  ging accuracy if unknown words are correctly seg  mented.
	
	
			In Japanese, around 95% word segmentation ac  curacy is reported by using a word-based lan  guage model and the Viterbi-like dynamic program  ming procedures (Nagata, 1994; Yamamoto, 1996; Takeuchi and Matsumoto, 1997; Haruno and Mat  sumoto, 1997).
			About the same accuracy is reported in Chinese by statistical methods (Sproat et al., 1996).
			But there has been relatively little improve  ment in recent years because most of the remaining errors are due to unknown words.
			There are two approaches to solve this problem: to increase the coverage of the dictionary (Fung and Wu, 1994; Chang et al., 1995; Mori and Nagao, 1996) and to design a better model for unknown words (Nagata, 1996; Sproat et al., 1996).
			We take the latter approach.
			To improve word segmenta  tion accuracy, (Nagata, 1996) used a single general purpose unknown word model, while (Sproat et al., 1996) used a set of specific word models such as for plurals, personal names, and transliterated foreign words.
			' The goal of our research is to assign a correct part of speech to unknown word as well as identifying it correctly.
			In this paper, we present a novel statistical model for Japanese unknown words.
			It consists of a set of word models for each part of speech and word type.
			We classified Japanese words into nine orthographic types based on the character types that constitute a word.
			We find that by making different models for each word type, we can better model the length and spelling of unknown words.
			In the following sections, we first describe the lan  guage model used for Japanese word segmentation.
			We then describe a series of unknown word mod  els, from the baseline model to the one we propose.
			Finally, we prove the effectiveness of the proposed model by experiment.
	
	
			2.1 Baseline Language Model and Search.
			Algorithm Let the input Japanese character sequence be C = c1 ... em, and segment it into word sequence W = w1 ...Wn 1   The word segmentation task can be defined as finding the word segmentation W that max  imize the joint probability of word sequence given character sequence P(WIC).
			Since the maximiza  tion is carried out with fixed character sequence C, the word segmenter only has to maximize the joint probability of word sequence P(W).
			W = argmaxP(WIC) = argmaxP(W) (1) w w We call P(W) the segmentation model.
			We can use any type of word-based language model for P(W), such as word ngram and class-based ngram.
			We used the word bigram model in this paper.
			So, P(W) is approximated by the product of word hi  gram probabilities P(wilwi1)  P(W) P(w1l<bos>) fr=2 P(wilwi-l)P( <eos>lwn) (2) Here, the special symbols <bos> and <eos> indi  cate the beginning and the end of a sentence, re  spectively.
			Basically, word bigram probabilities of the word segmentation model is estimated by computing the 1 In this paper, we define a word as a combination of its surface form and part of speech.
			Two words are considered to be equal only if they have the same surface form and part of speech.

			Word Model 3.1 Baseline Model The simplest unknown word model depends only on relative frequencies of the corresponding events in the word segmented training corpus, with appropri  ate smoothing techniques.
			The maximization search can be efficiently implemented by using the Viterbi  like dynamic programming procedure described in (Nagata, 1994).
			2.2 Modification to Handle Unknown.
			Words To handle unknown words, we made a slight modi  fication in the above word segmentation model.
			We have introduced unknown word tags <U-t> for each part of speech t. For example, <U-noun> and <U  verb> represents an unknown noun and an unknown verb, respectively.
			If Wi is an unknown word whose part of speech is t, the word bigram probability P(wilwi1) is ap  proximated as the product of word bigram probabil  ity P( <U-t>lwi_I) and the probability of Wi given it is an unknown word whose part of speech is t, P(wii<U-t> ).
			P(wdwi1) = P( <U-t>lwi_I)P(wii<U-t>,Wi1) P( <U-t>lwi1)P(wii<U-t>) (3) the spelling.
			We think of an unknown word as a word having a special part of speech <UNK>.
			Then, the unknown word model is formally defined as the joint probability of the character sequence wi = c1 ... ck if it is an unknown word.
			Without loss of generality, we decompose it into the product of word length probability and word spelling probability given its length, P(wii<UNK>) = P(c1 ... cki<UNK>) = P(ki<UNK>)P(c1 ... cklk, <UNK>) (4) where k is the length of the character sequence.
			We call P(ki<UNK>) the word length model, and P( c1 ...
			Ck Ik, <UNK >) the word spelling model.
			In order to estimate the entropy of English, (Brown et al., 1992) approximated P(ki<UNK>) by a Poisson distribution whose parameter is the average word length A in the training corpus, and P(c1 ...
			Ck lk, <UNK>) by the product of character zerogram probabilities.
			This means all characters in the character set are considered to be selected inde  pendently and uniformly.
			Here, we made an assumption that the spelling P (c1 ..
			.ck I<UNK> ) k!
			Ak ->.
			k (5) of an unknown word solely depends on its part of speech and is independent of the previous word.
			This is the same assumption made in the hidden Markov model, which is called output independence.
			                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
			Here, a word is represented by a list of surface form, pronunciation, and part of speech, which are delimited by a slash '/'.
			The first 2 Throughout in this paper, we use the term "infrequent words" to represent words that appeared only once in the corpus.
			They are also called "hapax legomena" or "hapax words".
			It is well known that the characteristics of hapax where p is the inverse of the number of characters in the character set.
			If we assume JIS-X-0208 is used as the Japanese character set, p = 1/6879.
			Since the Poisson distribution is a single parame  ter distribution with lower bound, it is appropriate to use it as a first order approximation to the word length distribution.
			But the Brown model has two problems.
			It assigns a certain amount of probability mass to zero-length words, and it is too simple to express morphology.
			For Japanese word segmentation and OCR error correction, (Nagata, 1996) proposed a modified ver  sion of the Brown model.
			Nagata also assumed the word length probability obeys the Poisson distribu  tion.
			But he moved the lower bound from zero to one.
			legomena are similar to those of unknown words (Baayen and Sproat, 1996).

			When a substring of an unknown word coincides with other word in the dic  tionary, it is very likely to be decomposed into the dictionary word and the remaining substring.
			We find the reason of the decomposition is that the word                                                                                                                                                                                          
			                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
			The empirical and the estimated distributions agree fairly well.
			But the estimates by Poisson are smaller than empirical probabilities for shorter words ( <= 4 characters), and larger for longer words (>characters).
			This is because we rep                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
			                                                                                                                                      
			It shows that the length of kanji words distributes around 3 char  acters, while that of katakana words distributes around 5 characters.
			The empirical word length dis  tribution of                                                                 
			In the Japanese writing system, there are at least five different types of characters other than punc  tuation marks: kanji, hiragana, katakana, Roman alphabet, and Arabic numeral.
			Kanji which means 'Chinese character' is used for both Chinese origin words and Japanese words semantically equivalent to Chinese characters.
			Hiragana and katakana are syllabaries: The former is used primarily for gram  matical function words, such as particles and inflec  tional endings, while the latter is used primarily to transliterate Western origin words.
			Roman alphabet is also used for Western origin words and acronyms.
			Arabic numeral is used for numbers.
			Most Japanese words are written in kanji, while more recent loan words are written in katakana.
			K atakana words are likely to be used for techni  cal terms, especially in relatively new fields like computer science.
			Kanji words are shorter than katakana words because kanji is based on a large (> 6,000) alphabet of ideograms while katakana is based on a small ( < 100) alphabet of phonograms.
			                                                                                                                  
			It shows approximately 65% of words are constituted by a single character type.
			Among the words that are constituted by more than two character types, only the kanjihiragana and hiraganakanji sequences are morphemes and others are compound words in a strict sense although they are identified as words in the EDR corpus 3 . Therefore, we classified Japanese words into 9 word types based on the character types that consti  tute a word: <sym>, <num>, <alpha>, <hira>, <kata>, and <kan> represent a sequence of sym  bols, numbers, alphabets, hiraganas, katakanas, and kanjis, respectively.
			<kanhira> and <hirakan> represent a sequence of kanjis followed by hiraganas and that of hiraganas followed by kanjis, respec  tively.
			The rest are classified as <mise>.
			The resulting unknown word model is as follows.
			We first select the word type, then we select the length and spelling.

			Morphology It is obvious that the beginnings and endings of words play an important role in tagging part of speech.
			                                                                                                                         
			                                                                                              
			This symbol typically appears at the end of transliterated Western origin words written in katakana.
			It is natural to make a model for each part of speech.
			The resulting unknown word model is as follows.
			P(c1 ... cki<U-t>) = P(ki<U-t> )P(c1 ... ckik, <U-t>) (12)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
			This results in kanjihiragana sequence.
			When a Chinese character is too difficult to read, it is transliterated in hiragana.
			This results in either hiraganakanji or kanji  hiragana sequence.
			type and part of speech information.
			This is the un  known word model we propose in this paper.
			It first selects the word type given the part of speech, then the word length and spelling.

			To estimate the probabilities of the combinations of word type and part of speech that did not appeared in the training corpus, we used the Witten-Bell method (Witten and Bell, 1991) to obtain an esti  mate for the sum of the probabilities of unobserved events.
			We then redistributed this evenly among all unobserved events 4 .                                                                                               A<WT>,<U-t> is the average length of words whose word type is <WT> and part of speech is <U-t>.

			f(c;ic;_1, <WT>, <U-t>) = C(<WT>,<U-t>,c;-t,c;) C( <WT>,<U-t>,c;-t) However, if we divide the corpus by the combina  tion of word type and part of speech, the amount of each training data becomes very small.
			Therefore, we linearly interpolated the following five probabili  ties (Jelinek and Mercer, 1980).
			P(e;ic;-1,<WT>,<U-t>) = 4 The Witten-Bell method estimates the probability of ob  serving novel events to be r/(n+r), where n is the total num  ber of events seen previously, and r is the number of symbols that are distinct.
			The probability of the event observed c times is cf(n + r).
			a1 +a2+a3+a4+as = 1.
			f(ci, <WT>, <U-t>) and f(c;lc;-1, <WT>, <U-t>) are the relative frequen  cies of the character unigram and bigram for each word type and part of speech.
			f(c;) and f(c;jc;_1) are the relative frequencies of the character unigram and bigram.
			V is the number of characters (not to  kens but types) appeared in the corpus.
			4 Experiments.
			4.1 Training and Test Data for the.
			Language Model We used the EDR Japanese Corpus Version 1.0 (EDR, 1991) to train the language model.
			It is a manually word segmented and tagged corpus of ap  proximately 5.1 million words (208 thousand sen  tences).
			It contains a variety of Japanese sentences taken from newspapers, magazines, dictionaries, en  cyclopedias, textbooks, etc..
			In this experiment, we randomly selected two sets of 100 thousand sentences.
			The first 100 thousand sentences are used for training the language model.
			The second 100 thousand sentences are used for test  ing.
			The remaining 8 thousand sentences are used as a heldout set for smoothing the parameters.
			For the evaluation of the word segmentation ac  curacy, we randomly selected 5 thousand sentences from the test set of 100 thousand sentences.
			We call the first test set (100 thousand sentences) "test set-1" and the second test set (5 thousand sentences) "test set-2".
			                                                                                           
			There were 94,680 distinct words in the training test.
			We discarded the words whose frequency was one, and made a dictionary of 45,027 words.
			Af  ter replacing the words whose frequency was one with the corresponding unknown word tags, there were 474,155 distinct word bigrams.
			We discarded the bigrams with frequency one, and the remaining 175,527 bigrams were used in the word segmentation model.
			                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
			There were 3,120 dis  tinct character unigrams and 55,486 distinct char  acter bigrams.
			We discarded the bigram with fre  quency one and remaining 20,775 bigrams were used.
			There were 12,633 distinct character unigrams and 80,058 distinct character bigrams when we classified them for each word type and part of speech.
			We discarded the bigrams with frequency one and re  0.85 0.7 POS + WT + Poisson + bigram -+  POS + Poisson + bigram -+--  maining 26,633 bigrams were used in the unknown word model.
			Average word lengths for each word type and part of speech were also computed from the words with frequency one in the training set.
			4.2 Cross Entropy and Perplexity.
			                                                                                                
			                                                                                                            (Poisson + zerogram).
			                                                                                                                                    
			                                                                                                                 
			Cross entropy was computed over the words in test set-1 that were not found in the dictionary of the word segmentation model (56,121 words).
			Character perplexity is more intu  itive than cross entropy because it shows the average number of equally probable characters out of 6,879 characters in JIS-X-0208.
			                                                                                                                          
			It also shows that by making a separate model for each word type, character per  plexity is reduced by an additional 45% (128 --+ 71).
			This shows that the word type information is useful for modeling the morphology of Japanese words.

			It shows the accuracies up to the top 10 candidates.

			                                                                               o.s51 ---:23 _.-J4L----'-5--6.L...----'7----'-8--9'-- J10 Rank                                                                                                                 
			The test words are the same 56,121 words used to compute the cross entropy.
			Since these unknown word models give the prob  ability of spelling for each part of speech P(wit), we used the empirical part of speech probability P(t) to compute the joint probability P(w, t).
			The part of speech t that gives the highest joint probability is selected.
			i = argmp.xP(w, t) = P(t)P(wit) (18) The part of speech prediction accuracy of the first and the second model was 67.5% and 74.4%, respec  tively.
			                                                                                        
			4.4 Word Segmentation Accuracy.
			Word segmentation accuracy is expressed in terms of recall and precision as is done in the previous research (Sproat et al., 1996).
			Let the number of words in the manually segmented corpus be Std, the number of words in the output of the word segmenter be Sys, and the number of matched words be M. Recall is defined as M/Std, and precision is defined as M/Sys.
			Since it is inconvenient to use both recall and precision all the time, we also use the F-measure to indicate the overall performance.
			It is calculated by F = (!3 2 + 1.0) X p X R (32 X p + R (19) where Pis precision, R is recall, and (3 is the relative importance given to recall over precision.
			                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
			0 65 .0 62 .0 61 .5 66 .4 42.
			7 52 .5 48 .3 51.
			4 f3 = 1.0 throughout this experiment.
			That is, we put equal importance on recall and precision.
			                                                                                         
			Com  pared to the baseline model (Poisson+ bigram), by using word type and part of speech information, the precision of the proposed model (POS + WT + Pois  son + bigram) is improved by a modest 0.6%.
			The impact of the proposed model is small because the out-of-vocabulary rate of test set-2 is only 3.1%.
			To closely investigate the effect of the proposed unknown word model, we computed the word seg  mentation accuracy of unknown words.
			                          
			The accuracy of the proposed model (POS + WT + Poisson + bigram) is signif  icantly higher than the baseline model (Poisson + bigram).
			Recall is improved from 31.8% to 42.0% and precision is improved from 65.0% to 66.4%.
			Here, recall is the percentage of correctly seg  mented unknown words in the system output to the all unknown words in the test sentences.
			Precision is the percentage of correctly segmented unknown words in the system's output to the all words that system identified as unknown words.
			                                                    
			Notice that the baseline model (Poisson + bigram) cannot predict part of speech.
			To roughly estimate the amount of improvement brought by the proposed model, we applied a simple tagging strat  egy to the output of the baseline model.
			That is, words that include numbers are tagged as numbers, and others are tagged as nouns.
			                                                                                                                                                           
			Other than the usual recall/precision measures, we defined another precision                   , which roughly correspond to the tagging accuracy in English where word segmentation is trivial.
			Prec2 is defined as the percentage of correctly tagged un  known words to the correctly segmented unknown words.
			                                                                       
			The tagging accuracy in context (96.6%) is significantly higher than that without context (74.4%).
			This shows that the word bigrams using unknown word tags for each part of speech are useful to predict the part of speech.
	
	
			Since English uses spaces between words, unknown words can be identified by simple dictionary lookup.
			So the topic of interest is part of speech estimation.
			Some statistical model to estimate the part of speech of unknown words from the case of the first letter and the prefix and suffix is proposed (Weischedel et al., 1993; Brill, 1995; Ratnaparkhi, 1996; Mikheev, 1997).
			On the contrary, since Asian languages like Japanese and Chinese do not put spaces between words, previous work on unknown word problem is focused on word segmentation; there are few studies estimating part of speech of unknown words in Asian languages.
			The cues used for estimating the part of speech of unknown words for Japanese in this paper are ba  sically the same for English, namely, the prefix and suffix of the unknown word as well as the previous and following part of speech.
			The contribution of this paper is in showing the fact that different char  acter sets behave differently in Japanese and a better word model can be made by using this fact.
			By introducing different length models based on character sets, the number of decomposition errors of unknown words are significantly reduced.
			In other words, the tendency of over-segmentation is cor  rected.
			                                                                                                                                     
			This is the main reason of the remaining under-segmented and over-segmented errors.
			To improve the unknown word model, feature  based approach such as the maximum entropy method (Ratnaparkhi, 1996) might be useful, be  cause we don't have to divide the training data into several disjoint sets (like we did by part of speech and word type) and we can incorporate more lin  guistic and morphological knowledge into the same probabilistic framework.
			We are thinking of re  implementing our unknown word model using the maximum entropy method as the next step of our research.
			                                                                                                                                                                               ) r e c pr ec F pr ec 2 Po iss on +b igr a m W T + P o is s o n + b i g r a m P O S + P o is s o n + b i g r a m P O S + W T + P o is s o n + b i g r a m 28 .1 37 .7 37 .5 40 .6 57 .3 51 .5 58 .1 64 .1 37 .7 43 .5 45 .6 49 .7 8 8 . 2 8 7 . 9 9 4 . 3 9 6 . 6
	
	
			We present a statistical model of Japanese unknown words using word morphology and word context.
			We find that Japanese words are better modeled by clas  sifying words based on the character sets (kanji, hi  ragana, katakana, etc.) and its changes.
			This is because the different character sets behave differ  ently in many ways (historical etymology, ideogram vs. phonogram, etc.).
			Both word segmentation ac  curacy and part of speech tagging accuracy are im  proved by treating them differently.
